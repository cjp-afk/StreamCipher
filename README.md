# StreamCipher

*A Hands-On Exploration of Stream Cipher Design*

## üîê Overview

This project is a university assignment focused on implementing a stream cipher from scratch. The primary objective was to delve into the mechanics of stream ciphers, understanding their operation without relying on existing cryptographic libraries. This endeavor provided practical experience in cryptographic algorithm design and reinforced theoretical knowledge acquired during coursework.

## üß† Learning Objectives

* **Algorithm Design**: Grasp the principles behind stream ciphers and their implementation.
* **Bitwise Operations**: Apply bit-level manipulations essential for encryption and decryption processes.
* **Key Stream Generation**: Understand the creation and utilization of pseudo-random key streams.
* **Security Considerations**: Recognize potential vulnerabilities and the importance of secure key management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

* **Language**: Python
* **Core Concepts**:

  * Generation of a pseudo-random key stream.
  * Encryption and decryption using XOR operations between the key stream and plaintext/ciphertext.
  * Handling of synchronization between encryption and decryption processes.

*Note: This implementation is for educational purposes and is not intended for production use.*
